# Clicked-Sprint-Creating-and-Implementing-A-Cybersecurity-Program
This is a Sprint hosted by Clicked.

## Scenario
Lemonade, an online insurance company that covers everything from pets to laptops to your home, has been in the process of having an external team work on a cybersecurity program for them to implement. Being a small company, there was no program in place up until now.

Lemonade is seeking out a comprehensive program that makes sense for their size and service offerings, most especially as they launched their AI model to predict catastrophes and claims, and uses that data to price their policies.

You will be working closely with Nell Crain, CTO and Rhea Ripley, CIO to complete this project.

## Learning Objectives 
- **Cybersecurity Fundamentals:** Understand the core principles and components of a comprehensive cybersecurity program
- **Risk Assessment and Management:** Learn how to identify, analyze, and mitigate potential security risks within an organization
- **Implementation Strategies:** Gain practical experience in deploying cybersecurity tools and technologies to protect organizational assets

## Content
- Risk Assessment: Documentation of identified risks based on discussion with stakeholders and research on potential additional risks for the company Lemonade.
- Cybersecurity Program: Presentation of a cybersecurity plan that outlines the goals and objectives of the program, as well as the strategies and tactics that will be used to achieve them to Lemonade, a small online insurance company.
